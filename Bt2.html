   <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
   <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century.<b>Leohard Euler</b>was born in Basel,Swizerland.There, he studied under another giant
of mathematics,<b>Jean Bernoulli</b>.In 1731, Euler became a professor of physics and mathemtics at St.Peterburg Academy of Sciences. Euler
was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and
astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematician analysis.<i>Introduction in analysis infinitorum</i> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well
over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessan he wrote <i>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemane</i> (1768-1772),giving a clear non-technical 
outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>
<p>One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings.He is perhaps
   best known for his research in to mathematicial analysis. Euler's formula </p>
   <p>cos()x + isin(x) = e<sup>(ix)</sup></p>
   <p>demontrates the relationship between algebre, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation. It's easy to decvice the equation</p>
   <p>e<sup>(&pi; i)</sup> + 1 = 0 </p>
   <p>wich relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, e,and i in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
   <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
